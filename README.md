## Project Structure

```
src/
  app/
    layout.tsx          # Root layout with fonts and metadata
    page.tsx           # Main chat interface component
    globals.css        # Global styles with Tailwind CSS
```

## Key Technologies

- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router
- **React 19**: Latest React with hooks and modern features
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **OpenAI SDK**: Official OpenAI JavaScript client

## API Usage

The app uses OpenAI's Chat Completions API with the following configuration:

- **Model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo` (fast and cost-effective)
- **Max Tokens**: 500 (controls response length)
- **Context**: Maintains conversation history for coherent dialogue

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Customization

You can easily customize the chat bot by:

1. **Changing the AI Model**: Edit the `model` parameter in `page.tsx`
2. **Adjusting Response Length**: Modify the `max_tokens` parameter
3. **Styling**: Update Tailwind classes or add custom CSS
4. **Adding Features**: Extend the component with new functionality

## Important Notes

### Browser-Side API Calls

This implementation makes API calls directly from the browser using `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`. This is acceptable for personal use but for production applications, consider:

1. Creating a backend API route to proxy OpenAI requests
2. Implementing proper authentication and rate limiting
3. Using environment variables for additional security

### Cost Considerations

- Each message costs a small amount based on OpenAI's pricing
- Monitor your usage at [OpenAI Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**: Make sure your API key starts with `sk-` and has sufficient credits
2. **Network Error**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings
3. **Blank Responses**: Verify your API key has proper permissions

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your API key at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
- Ensure you have billing set up with OpenAI
